# Feature Engineering and ML Workflow

This document describes the current feature engineering, PCA, logistic
regression, backtesting, and paper-trading workflow in the Alpaca market data
terminal.

The system has two user-facing modes:

- `backtesting.py`: evaluates rule-based strategies and the ML strategy on
  historical data.
- `trading.py`: trains a selected-equity ML model, refreshes the latest signal,
  and submits Alpaca paper-trading orders from the latest signal.

## High-Level Data Flow

```text
Selected ticker
  -> Alpaca daily OHLCV data
  -> src/features.py
     -> build_ml_features()
     -> build_feature_pca_pipeline()
  -> src/models.py
     -> train_classifier()
     -> run_ml_signal_pipeline()
  -> src/backtester.py
     -> build_ml_strategy_spec()
     -> run_backtest()
     -> build_buy_hold_result()
  -> src/metrics.py and src/plots.py
     -> metrics table and charts
  -> src/execution.py
     -> execute_latest_signal() for Alpaca paper trading
```

## Module Boundaries

### `src/features.py`

Owns feature engineering, target construction, chronological train/test split,
standardization, PCA fitting, and PCA transformation.

Important objects and functions:

- `PCAFeatureResult`: container for feature data, fitted scaler, fitted PCA,
  train/test PCA matrices, labels, indices, and explained variance.
- `build_ml_features(df, price_col="close", target_col="target")`: creates the
  technical-indicator feature matrix and binary next-period target.
- `get_feature_columns(df=None, include_missing=False)`: returns the feature
  columns used by the ML pipeline.
- `build_feature_pca_pipeline(...)`: builds features if needed, splits rows
  chronologically, fits `StandardScaler` and `PCA` on training rows only, then
  transforms all feature-ready rows.
- `transform_features_with_pipeline(...)`: transforms new data with an already
  fitted scaler and PCA object.
- `transform_latest_features(...)`: returns only the latest PCA-transformed row
  for fast trading-mode inference.

`src/features.py` should not train the classifier or submit trades.

### `src/models.py`

Owns classifier training, probability scoring, and ML signal generation. It
starts after PCA-ready data exists.

Important objects and functions:

- `PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD = 0.60`: default cutoff for a long signal.
- `MLSignalResult`: container for the signal DataFrame, fitted model, PCA
  result, PCA component columns, threshold, and signal policy.
- `train_classifier(pca_result, classifier=None)`: trains the classifier on
  `pca_result.X_train_pca` and `pca_result.y_train`.
- `run_ml_signal_pipeline(...)`: trains logistic regression and returns an
  `MLSignalResult`.
- `score_pca_features(...)`: scores any PCA-ready frame with an already fitted
  model and appends standard ML signal columns.
- `generate_ml_signals(...)`: compatibility wrapper that returns only the
  signal DataFrame.
- `predict_latest_signal(...)`: returns the latest long/flat signal summary.

The selected model is logistic regression:

```python
LogisticRegression(
    max_iter=1000,
    class_weight="balanced",
    solver="lbfgs",
    random_state=42,
)
```

Signal rule:

```text
P(next-day return > 0) > 0.60 -> Long
P(next-day return > 0) <= 0.60 -> Flat
```

`src/models.py` should not build raw features, fit PCA, run backtests, or submit
Alpaca orders.

### `src/backtester.py`

Owns portfolio simulation and trade logs for both rule-based strategies and the
ML signal.

Important functions:

- `build_ml_strategy_spec()`: maps ML signal columns to the generic backtester
  contract.
- `run_backtest(signal_df, strategy, initial_capital=...)`: simulates strategy
  returns, portfolio value, drawdown, and trade events.
- `build_buy_hold_result(df, initial_capital=...)`: builds the buy-and-hold
  benchmark.
- `build_trade_log(...)`: creates closed-trade records from trade signals.

### `src/execution.py`

Owns Alpaca paper-trading execution only. It receives model-generated signal
rows and does not know how features, PCA, or model training work.

Important functions:

- `get_latest_signal(signal_df)`: extracts the latest usable ML signal row.
- `get_current_position(symbol, trading_client=None)`: reads the current paper
  position for the ticker.
- `build_order_plan(...)`: converts the latest signal and current paper
  position into a `BUY`, `SELL`, `HOLD`, or `NONE` action.
- `submit_paper_order(order_plan, trading_client=None)`: submits the planned
  paper order to Alpaca.
- `execute_latest_signal(...)`: coordinates signal extraction, paper-position
  lookup, order planning, order submission, and logging.

Order behavior is long-only:

- Long signal and no current position: paper buy.
- Long signal and existing position: hold.
- Flat signal and open position: close paper position.
- Flat signal and no position: no order.

### `src/data_connector.py`

Owns Alpaca client creation.

Important functions:

- `get_historical_client(...)`: creates the Alpaca historical data client.
- `get_stream_client(...)`: creates the Alpaca streaming data client.
- `get_paper_trading_client(...)`: creates `TradingClient(..., paper=True)`.

## Feature Set

`build_ml_features()` uses daily OHLCV data and creates features from several
groups.

Returns and rolling statistics:

- `log_return`
- `rolling_mean_10`
- `rolling_std_10`
- `rolling_mean_20`
- `rolling_std_20`

Trend:

- `sma_10`
- `sma_20`
- `sma_50`
- `ema_12`
- `ema_26`
- `ema_20`
- `macd`
- `macd_signal`
- `macd_histogram`
- `adx_14`
- `plus_di_14`
- `minus_di_14`

Momentum:

- `rsi_14`
- `stoch_k_14`
- `stoch_d_3`
- `williams_r_14`

Volatility:

- `bb_middle_20`
- `bb_upper_20`
- `bb_lower_20`
- `bb_width_20`
- `bb_percent_b_20`
- `atr_14`

Volume:

- `obv`
- `cmf_20`
- `volume_sma_20`
- `volume_zscore_20`

Target:

- `target = 1` when the next-period return is positive.
- `target = 0` when the next-period return is non-positive.
- The final row has an unknown target and is kept as `NaN` so it can still be
  transformed for latest-signal inference.

## PCA and Leakage Control

`build_feature_pca_pipeline()` avoids future-data leakage by using a
chronological split:

1. Build all feature columns and the next-period target.
2. Drop rows that are not feature-complete.
3. Use only rows with known targets for supervised train/test splitting.
4. Split chronologically with the configured `test_size`.
5. Fit `StandardScaler` on training features only.
6. Fit `PCA(n_components=variance_threshold, svd_solver="full")` on scaled
   training features only.
7. Transform training, test, and latest feature-ready rows with the fitted
   scaler/PCA objects.

The default PCA variance threshold is `0.80`, so the pipeline keeps enough
principal components to explain at least 80% of training-set feature variance.

## Backtesting Mode

The ML backtesting flow lives in `backtesting.py`.

Important functions:

- `get_daily_price_data_for_ml(...)`: ensures the ML workflow uses daily bars
  even when the chart uses another timeframe.
- `build_ml_logistic_regression_backtest(...)`: builds PCA features, trains
  logistic regression, filters to the holdout rows, and runs the ML and
  buy-and-hold backtests.
- `retrain_ml_logistic_regression_backtest(...)`: refetches/prepares daily
  data and rebuilds the ML holdout backtest.
- `get_ml_backtest_cache()` and `build_ml_backtest_cache_key(...)`: cache
  backtest results by symbol, date range, threshold, split, and initial capital.

Default controls:

- Initial capital: `$100,000`
- Probability threshold: `0.60`
- Holdout test split: `0.20`
- PCA variance threshold: `0.80`

The ML strategy is tested only on rows labeled `ml_sample_type == "test"`.
This means the model trains on earlier data and evaluates on later unseen daily
bars.

## Trading Mode

The ML trading panel lives in `trading.py`.

Important functions:

- `render_ml_trading_panel(symbol, is_valid_symbol)`: renders controls, cached
  model state, metrics, charts, trades, paper-order controls, and logs.
- `_build_ml_results(...)`: fetches 5 years of daily bars, builds PCA features,
  trains the model, generates ML signals, runs a holdout backtest, and builds
  metrics.
- `_train_ml_panel_state(...)`: creates the cached per-symbol model state.
- `_build_fresh_latest_signal(...)`: fetches latest daily bars and transforms
  the newest row through the cached scaler/PCA/model path.
- `_read_paper_trading_log(...)`: reads recent log lines for display in the UI.

Training and inference are intentionally separated:

1. User selects an equity.
2. User clicks `Train Model / Run Backtest` or `Retrain Model / Run Backtest`.
3. The fitted feature/PCA/model state is cached in `st.session_state`.
4. User clicks `Refresh Signal and Submit Paper Order`.
5. The app fetches latest daily data.
6. The app uses `transform_latest_features()` to apply the cached scaler/PCA
   pipeline.
7. The app uses `score_pca_features()` to score the latest row with the cached
   logistic regression model.
8. The resulting latest signal is passed to `execute_latest_signal()`.

This keeps the trading panel responsive because paper-order clicks do not
retrain the model.

## Standard ML Signal Columns

After `score_pca_features()` or `run_ml_signal_pipeline()`, downstream modules
expect these columns:

- `ml_probability`: probability that the next-period return is positive.
- `ml_predicted_target`: class prediction using a 0.50 threshold.
- `ml_raw_signal`: raw long/flat decision from the configured threshold.
- `ml_signal`: display label, either `Long` or `Flat`.
- `ml_position`: numeric long-only position, `1` for long and `0` for flat.
- `ml_trade_signal`: position change, `1` buy, `-1` sell, `0` no change.
- `ml_buy_signal`: boolean buy marker.
- `ml_sell_signal`: boolean sell marker.
- `ml_sample_type`: `train`, `test`, `latest_unlabeled`, or `not_ready`.

## Collaboration Notes

When modifying this workflow, keep these boundaries intact:

- Put raw feature construction, target alignment, scaling, and PCA in
  `src/features.py`.
- Put classifier training and signal generation in `src/models.py`.
- Put portfolio simulation in `src/backtester.py`.
- Put paper-account inspection, order planning, order submission, and logging
  in `src/execution.py`.
- Put Alpaca client construction in `src/data_connector.py`.
- Keep Streamlit display and session-state orchestration in `trading.py` and
  `backtesting.py`.

This separation makes it easier to test each layer independently and prevents
paper-trading execution code from depending on feature-engineering details.
